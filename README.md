# sql-capstone-project
SQL Queries and Database Management.
Tasked with completing a capstone project that required querying and analyzing an airline database using SQL. The primary goal was to extract useful insights from the airline-related datasets, including flight, airport, and aircraft information, by writing complex SQL queries.
Write and execute SQL queries based on the provided questions, which required working with various tables from the database, such as Flights, Airports, and Aircrafts. This involved understanding the schema, joining multiple tables, filtering results, and ensuring accurate data extraction.
Analyze the database schema, which included tables like airports_data, aircrafts_data, and others. Wrote queries to extract columns, join tables, filter data, and perform calculations.
Efficiently retrieved the required data, which helped gain a deeper understanding of SQL operations such as table joins, filtering, and aggregate functions.
